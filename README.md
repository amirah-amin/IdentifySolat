# IdentifySolat
Solat Pattern Identification 

Official repository for Project "Solat Tracker: Solat Pattern Identification of Muslim Prayer (Solat) Performance". This project is initiated with the objective to develop a deep learning model to identify user's solat pattern. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

* Python 3.6 - See this link [How to install Python on Window](https://www.howtogeek.com/197947/how-to-install-python-on-windows/) if you are beginner to Python. 
* To ease the set up, you may download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). In this case, you are no longer require to install Python 3.6 because anaconda comes together with python sdk. Just select which OS that your laptop are running on and make sure the python version of the anaconda installer is Python 3.6. 

Just to make sure everthing is ok, you may run these commands on your cmd. This only possible once you set your anaconda directory in your system enviroment PATH.

```
conda --version
conda 4.5.11

python --version
Python 3.6.5 :: Anaconda, Inc.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. The first step would be to clone this repo in a folder in your local machine. To do that you need to run following command in command prompt or in git bash.

```
git clone https://github.com/amirah-amin/IdentifySolat.git
```
